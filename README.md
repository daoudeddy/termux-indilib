# termux-indilib

#### Note: this is just a POC dont expect to get full functionality since Android has limited linux compatibility

## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/daoudeddy/termux-indilib.git
cd termux-indilib
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```

## Does it Work?
AFAIK everything is working fine except some functionalities need to be run as root

## How did you get it working?
There's a patch file included in this repo with the changes needed to make work you can check it

## How about indi-3rdparty
I have made some tests but got a lot of error, will push a script later on so you can test it and help, and later make it official if possible

## Another note
You can create an issue with the problem you're facing so we can fix it
